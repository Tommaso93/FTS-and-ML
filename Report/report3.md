Third report - 05/08/2016

-------------------------

Progress with the conversion between .json and .csv (managed to convert a small file about 5 GB into a personal workspace on my VM)

Attended another lecture of the hadoop series (Spark interface). 

As previously stated I started to select some useful variables for ML training, trying also to make some useful histograms using R.

On Friday, we had a meeting for the next stages of our work: in particular trying to improve the python script in order to filter and parse the FTS json. Meanwhile iâ€™ll continue working on the variable selection.
