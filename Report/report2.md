Second report - 23/07/2016

-------------------------

Installed another VM in order to install the last version of DCAFPilot (0.1.26).

Attended another lecture of the hadoop series (data ingestion).

Encountered some issues while trying to convert the .json file in .csv inside the VM (I am trying to fix it).

Next step: start training .csv data using DCAFPilot and start thinking of interesting variables for ML.
I will attend ML lectures next week from Openlab.
