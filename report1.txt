First report - 15/07/2016

-------------------------

Learned basics of DCAFPilot (and installed in my CERN VM) as well as Hadoop (Impala, Avro, Spark), during some IT lectures and home exercises.

The conversion program from .json to .csv (both hashed or not) was started and developed during the past weeks from Zygimantas.
